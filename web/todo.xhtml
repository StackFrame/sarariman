        <h1>Todo list for Sarariman</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Clean it up and publish it under an open source license.</li>
            <li>Labor category assignment needs a unique key constraint (I accidentally created a duplicate).</li>
            <li>Add a nag action to the timesheets page for approvers that sends email to those who have not submitted.</li>
            <li>Add an active column to projects table.</li>
            <li>Add submitted/approved status to unbilled hours page.</li>
            <li>Make printable PDF reports for customers.</li>
            <li>Make it possible to send email to customers directly.</li>
            <li>Need a table that keeps track of tasks that can be worked by a particular employee so that that employee can be
                presented with a more manageable list of tasks to choose from.</li>
            <li>Disallow recording entries in the future unless they are for paid time off.</li>
            <li>Do sanitization of HTML description entries.</li>
            <li>Do date format checking before it hits the database.</li>
            <li>Suggestion from George Streeper: Allow entry of a task by task number.</li>
            <li>Suggestion from George Streeper: Allow the user to maintain a list of preferred tasks.</li>
            <li>Would it make sense to sort according to activity?</li>
            <li>Break out the SAIC code into a separate project which references this one.</li>
            <li>There is some bug in timesheets.jsp.  I think it is getting the start date wrong.  If you submit a timesheet in the
                middle of the week and go to timesheets.jsp directly, it doesn't enable the "Approve" and "Reject" buttons.</li>
            <li>Remove the underline in the hyperlink at the bottom of print CSS for timereport.jsp and SAIC version.</li>
            <li>Use the fullTime bit in LDAP for pings and for enabling the "Submit" button.</li>
            <li>Check for more than 40 hours registered and non-zero PTO.</li>
            <li>Need a report for billable hours not tracked by a project.</li>
            <li>Make the nag emails look at the hire date so that we don't nag before the person actually starts.</li>
            <li>Add vCard export to contacts and contact pages.</li>
            <li>Disable timesheet/invoice send button when there are no "to" values.</li>
        </ul>
