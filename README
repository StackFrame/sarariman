Sarariman is the "operating system" for StackFrame. It implements a lot of the
workflow of daily operations. It supports tracking time, creating and sending
invoices to clients, managing trouble tickets, etc.

It started out as a system for tracking billable time, but since has grown out
of control and integrates with external systems such as Twilio.
